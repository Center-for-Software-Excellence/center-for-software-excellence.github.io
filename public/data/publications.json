By having a cognitive architecture that enhances FMs with Theory-of-Mind capabilities, our approach considers the mental states and perspectives of software makers. This allows our solution to iteratively clarify the beliefs, desires, and intentions of stakeholders, translating these into a set of refined requirements and a corresponding actionable natural language workflow in the often-overlooked requirements refinement phase of software engineering, which is crucial after initial elicitation.",

Our method enables verification that compiled artifacts match their source code and build specifications, enhancing security and trust in software supply chains. The approach addresses challenges specific to Java ecosystems including dependency management and build tool integration.",

To avoid misleading practitioners, AIOps model interpretations should be consistent (i.e., different AIOps models on the same task agree with one another on feature importance). However, many AIOps studies violate established practices in the machine learning community when deriving interpretations.",

Cross-project JIT models have been introduced to address the suboptimal performance of JIT models when historical data is limited. However, many studies built cross-project JIT models using a pool of mixed data from multiple projects (i.e., data merging)—assuming that the properties of defect-introducing commits of a project are similar to that of the other projects, which is likely not true.",
